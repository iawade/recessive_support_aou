    "- **Notebook setup**: Import Unifier python library, read reference tables into memory.\n",
    "- **Unit harmonization and outlier removal**: Select measurement of interest, harmonize all reported units to a standard unit, and remove outlier values.\n",
    "- **Data visualization**: Plot the data before and after unit harmonization to assess efficacy and identify the need for further quality control processes.\n",
    "- **Quality control**: Drop data for the selected laboratory measurement at sites with data quality concerns after unit harmonization, as needed.\n",
    "- **Changing outlier boundaries**: Change the thresholds used to define outliers for the selected laboratory measurement, as needed.\n",
    "- **Participant-level summary**: Obtain a table of participant-level summary (min, median, max, latest, and count of measurements) from the curated data.\n",
